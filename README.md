Vigenère Cipher Decryption Tool
Overview

This Python program demonstrates Vigenère cipher decryption, a classical cryptographic technique that uses a keyword to decode encrypted text.
It allows users to input a ciphertext and a key, then decrypts the message back to plaintext by applying modular arithmetic on letters of the alphabet.

The project also includes helper functions to clean user input and handle key generation.

Features
Generates a random 4-letter encryption key.
Preprocesses text by removing non-alphabetic characters and converting all letters to uppercase.
Implements manual Vigenère decryption using ASCII and modular arithmetic.
Demonstrates object-oriented structure through the Victor_decrypt class.
